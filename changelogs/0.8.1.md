# [0.8.1] - 2019-06-19

## Fixed

- Fixed the issue [#25](https://github.com/tartiflette/tartiflette-aiohttp/issues/25) thrown by @arjandepooter

It was impossible to execute subscription with this piece of code.

```python
def run():
    app = web.Application()

    engine: Engine = create_engine(
       ...
    )

    web.run_app(
        register_graphql_handlers(
            app=app,
            engine=engine,
            subscription_ws_endpoint="/ws",
        )
    )
```
