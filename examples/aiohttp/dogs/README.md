# Tatiflette AIOHTTP - WebSockets subscriptions

This is a fully Dockerised example.

If you want to test and run it, the only command to run is: `make run`.

`Docker` & `docker-compose` are mandatory to run this example.

Should work with:
* Docker >= 18.06
* docker-compose >= 1.22.0

Once everything is up, you can go to `http://localhost:8090/graphiql` to 
access the GraphiQL instance linked to this example.
